This codes is the full setup that I played on 11 December 2021 at Taksim/Beyoğlu/Sahika.

All codes in one page but actually they are in different buffers on <a href="https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi">Sonic Pi</a>. This is indicated in the text by buffer numbers. So when I play on stage, I'm proceeding in the order of the buffer in the text. 



I created some of my samples myself, and some I found on the <a href="https://freesound.org//">freesound.org</a>. You can find all the samples I used in the file named <a href="https://github.com/quatronostro/11december2021-sonicpicodes/blob/main/Samples.rar">Samples</a>. I'm sorry the file directories are a bit complicated, but I have filed the audio files according to their buffers for easy access. But if want to use this samples, you have to change directory. So watch out for file extensions

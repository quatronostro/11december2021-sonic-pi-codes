This codes is the full setup that I played on 11 December 2021 at Taksim/BeyoÄŸlu/Sahika.

All codes in one page but actually they are in different buffers on <a href="https://github.com/sonic-pi-net/sonic-pi" target="_blank">Sonic Pi</a>. This is indicated in the text by buffer numbers. So when I play on stage, I'm proceeding in the order of the buffer in the text. 



I created some of my samples myself, and some I found on the <a href="https://freesound.org/" target="_blank">freesound.org</a>. You can find all the samples I used in the file named <a href="https://github.com/quatronostro/11december2021-sonicpicodes/blob/main/Samples.rar" target="_blank">Samples</a>. I'm sorry the file directories are a bit complicated, but I have filed the audio files according to their buffers for easy access. But if want to use this samples, you have to change directory. So watch out for file extensions

Extra information: I'm using Sonic Pi v3.3.1 on Win 10

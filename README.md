# 11december2021-sonicpicodes
This codes is the full setup that I played on 11 December 2021 at Taksim/BeyoÄŸlu/Sahika.

All codes in one page but actually they are in different buffers. This is indicated in the text by buffer numbers. So when I play on stage, I'm proceeding in the order of the buffer in the text. 

I created some of my samples myself, and some I found on the <a href="https://freesound.org//">freesound.org</a>. You can find all the samples I used in the file named samples. But if want to use this samples, you have to change directory.
